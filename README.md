# COS513_Project

Project created for COS513 - Computational Intelligent Systems


## Dataset


The dataset retrieved from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) reffers to MRI images of a healthy and non-healthy brain ```brain_tunor_dataset```. The non-healthy brain can be seen as a brain that contains a tumor.
This dataset is divided into 

- yes folder, containing all the brain images with a tumor identified, 155 images
- no folder, containing all thr brain images with a tumor not identified, 98 images

Making a total of 253 images.

## Pre-Processing

For pre-processing steps the image data is standardized and transformed from rgb (...,3) to greyscale (...,1). 

After this pre-processing tha image data is the following (16 random examples):
